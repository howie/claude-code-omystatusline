## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- **Timeout mechanism** for voice playback (10-second timeout) to prevent `say` command from hanging indefinitely
- **Automatic retry logic** with single retry on first failure for improved reliability
- **Fallback to system sounds** when voice playback times out or fails after retries
- **CLI flags** for voice-reminder binary:
  - `--help` / `-h`: Display usage information and features
  - `--version` / `-v`: Show version information
- Enhanced debug logging for timeout events and retry attempts
- Improved error handling with detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Fixed
- Voice reminder hanging issue when macOS `say` command gets stuck (#7)
  - Previously 50% success rate (2/4 attempts failed)
  - Now protected by timeout mechanism with automatic recovery
- Zombie processes left behind when `say` command hangs
- Silent failures when audio device is locked or TTS engine encounters errors

### Changed
- Voice playback now uses goroutines with timeout channels for better reliability
- Updated speaker.go to include `SpeakWithLogger` function for better integration with debug logging
- Improved voice-reminder architecture with separate functions for macOS and Linux platforms

### Technical Details
- Timeout protection: 10 seconds maximum wait time for voice playback
- Retry delay: 500ms between retry attempts
- Maximum retries: 1 attempt before falling back to system sound
- Process cleanup: Automatic kill of hung processes after timeout
- Logger integration: Timeout events and retries logged to debug log
